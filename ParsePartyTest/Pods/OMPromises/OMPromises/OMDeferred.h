/** An OMDeferred is an abstract construct to control the outcome of an aligned
 OMPromise, which is used to proxy the outcome of an asynchronous operation.

 In order to model a long-running asynchronous operation, you would create an instance
 of OMDeferred using deferred. You use this instance to control the state of the
 underlying OMPromise, accessed by promise.

 You might call progress: multiple times to keep the user informed, followed by a final
 call to either fulfil:, in case everything went as expected, or fail: otherwise.

 It's important to understand that the OMDeferred/OMPromise is sealed, once its stated
 has been changed by calling fulfil: or fail:. After that calls to progress:, fulfil:
 or fail: result in an exception.
