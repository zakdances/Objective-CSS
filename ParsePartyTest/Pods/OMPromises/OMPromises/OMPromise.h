/** OMPromise proxies the outcome of a long-running asynchronous operation. It's
 a read-only object which is described essentially by state. The state defines
 how to interpret the values kept in result, error and progress.
 If state is equal to OMPromiseStateFulfilled, the value kept in result is meaningful.
 If state is equal to OMPromiseStateUnfulfilled, the value kept in error is meaningful.
 Otherwise the promise is unfulfilled and the user might consult progress for further
 information.

 In order to get informed if either progress, result or error change, one can register
 a block using progressed:, fulfilled: or failed: to get called. You might register
 multiple blocks for the same event. Also the methods return self in order to easily
 chain multiple method calls.

 Sometimes it might be necessary to create a promise, once a promise is fulfilled, thus
 building a chain of promises. That's the use-case of then:. The method takes a block
 that is called once the promise is fulfilled and returns a new promise. The supplied
 block has to return a value, either a promise or any other value, which is used to
 determine the outcome of the newly returned promise. If the promise fails the 
 block isn't called and the returned promise fails as well.

 If you want to build a chain in case the promise fails, you use rescue:. It's very
 similar to then:, but the supplied block is called in case the promise fails.
 
 To build more complex structures you might use one combinator of chain:initial:,
 all: or any:.
